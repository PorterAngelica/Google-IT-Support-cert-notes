# Process Management ‚ö°

## 1. Introduction
- One of the **most important tasks of the kernel** is **process management**.
- **Program vs. Process**:
  - **Program** = application you can run (e.g., Chrome).
  - **Process** = an instance of a program that is executing.
  - Example: Opening multiple Chrome windows = multiple processes from the same program.

## 2. Resource Allocation üñ•Ô∏è
- Programs need **resources** (CPU, RAM) to run.
- **Resources are finite**, so the kernel must allocate them efficiently.
- The kernel:
  - Creates processes when programs are launched.
  - Assigns hardware resources (CPU, RAM).
  - Runs system-critical background processes simultaneously.

---

## 3. CPU Scheduling & Time Slices ‚è±Ô∏è
- The CPU can only execute **one process at a time**.
- To simulate multitasking, the kernel uses **time slicing**:
  - Each process gets a **tiny interval of CPU time** (milliseconds).
  - The CPU rapidly switches between processes.
  - To humans, it looks like processes run **simultaneously**.
- **If system is slow**:
  1. A process may be hogging too many time slices.
  2. Too many processes may be competing for CPU time.

---

## 4. Process Termination & Resource Reallocation üõ†Ô∏è
- When a process ends, the kernel must:
  - Collect previously used resources (RAM, CPU cycles).
  - Reallocate them to other processes.
- Manual intervention may be needed if:
  - A process consumes too many resources (e.g., frozen apps).
  - There are too many processes overloading the system.

## 5. IT Support Notes üîë
- Understanding process management helps in:
  - **Diagnosing slow systems** (check CPU usage per process).
  - **Identifying resource hogs** (e.g., apps with memory leaks).
  - **Safely terminating processes** without crashing the OS.
- Tools:
  - **Windows** ‚Üí Task Manager.
  - **Linux** ‚Üí `top` / `htop`.
  - **Mac** ‚Üí Activity Monitor.

## 6. Study Guide Format (Cheat Sheet) üìã

### 6.1 Definitions
- **Program** = executable application.
- **Process** = running instance of a program.
- **Time Slice** = small CPU execution window for each process.
- **Scheduling** = how kernel decides which process runs when.

### 6.2 Key Concepts
- Kernel manages process creation, execution, and termination.
- CPU executes processes one at a time, but **time slicing** creates the illusion of multitasking.
- Performance issues may arise from:
  - One greedy process.
  - Too many active processes.

### 6.3 Steps in Process Management
1. Launch program ‚Üí kernel creates process.
2. Allocate resources (CPU/RAM).
3. Assign time slices for CPU execution.
4. Monitor process activity and performance.
5. Terminate processes ‚Üí reallocate resources.

## 7. Common IT Support Questions & Exercises ‚ùì

### Concept Questions
1. What is the difference between a **program** and a **process**?
2. What role does the **kernel** play in process management?
3. Explain what a **time slice** is and why it matters.
4. Why does the CPU appear to run multiple processes simultaneously?
5. What are two possible causes of a **slow CPU**?

### Practical Exercises
1. Open **Task Manager (Windows)** or `top` (Linux) and list the top 5 processes by CPU usage.
2. Launch multiple instances of the same program (e.g., browsers) and observe multiple processes.
3. Identify a process that consumes high CPU and terminate it ‚Äî note system response.
4. Research and explain how **multi-core CPUs** handle process scheduling.
5. Simulate overload: run multiple heavy apps and watch CPU time slices being stretched.

## 8. Summary ‚úÖ
- **Kernel manages processes**: creation, execution, scheduling, and termination.  
- **Programs vs. Processes**: A program may spawn multiple processes.  
- **Time slicing** lets a single CPU simulate multitasking by rapidly switching tasks.  
- **Performance issues** = greedy processes or too many competing processes.  
- **IT support** must know how to monitor and manage processes to keep systems stable.  

üîë **Pro Tip:** Always check for runaway processes before assuming hardware upgrades are necessary.
