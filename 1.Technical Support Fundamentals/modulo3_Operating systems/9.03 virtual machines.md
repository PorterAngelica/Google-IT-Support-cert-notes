# Virtual Machines (VMs) üñ•Ô∏èüíª

## 1. Introduction
- A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a copy of a real machine running inside your existing system.  
- Purpose: run an OS without needing separate physical hardware or dual-booting.

---

## 2. Key Features of Virtual Machines
- Use **physical resources**: CPU, memory, and storage.  
- Run **multiple OSs simultaneously**.  
- Isolated from the host machine ‚Üí prevents conflicts.  
- Easy to maintain, provision, and delete when no longer needed.  
- Useful for running software restricted to a specific OS.  

---

## 3. Applications in IT Support üõ†Ô∏è
- Create virtual computers on-demand for testing or training.  
- Safely experiment with different operating systems (e.g., Linux on a Windows host).  
- Reclaim resources by deleting VMs once tasks are complete.  
- Common tool: **VirtualBox** (example of VM software).

## 4. Hands-on Learning
- VMs are used in **Quick Labs platforms** for exercises.  
- Labs simulate real-world tasks while isolated from your physical machine.  
- Completing tasks in the VM earns credit in the lab environment.

## 5. Study Guide Concepts üìã

### 5.1 Definitions
- **Virtual Machine (VM)** = a software-based simulation of a physical computer.  
- **Host Machine** = the physical computer running the VM.  
- **Isolation** = VM runs independently from the host OS and other VMs.  

### 5.2 Key Points
- VMs allow running multiple OSs without extra hardware.  
- Ideal for testing, training, and using OS-specific software.  
- Efficient: create, use, and delete VMs as needed.

## 6. Practical Exercises ‚ùì
1. Install VirtualBox or VMware on your computer.  
2. Create a new VM with a Linux OS on a Windows host.  
3. Explore the VM interface ‚Üí install software and experiment safely.  
4. Delete the VM and observe how resources are freed.  

---

## 7. Summary ‚úÖ
- VMs simulate real computers using host resources.  
- Enable running multiple operating systems concurrently.  
- Essential for IT support training, testing, and troubleshooting.  

üîë **Pro Tip:** Always allocate resources thoughtfully; overcommitting memory or CPU can slow down both host and guest OS.
