**# BIOS – Study Guide

## 1. Device Communication and Drivers
- External devices (mouse, keyboard, webcam, printer, etc.) require **drivers** (small programs) so the CPU knows how to process input/output.
- Without drivers, the CPU wouldn’t understand raw input like a keyboard press.
- Drivers provide the instructions that bridge **hardware → CPU** communication.

## 2. BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
- **Definition**: Firmware stored on the motherboard that initializes hardware and boots the operating system.
- **Stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
  - Unlike RAM, **ROM is non-volatile** (data persists after shutdown).
- Once the OS loads, non-essential drivers are then loaded from the hard drive.

---

## 3. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
- A modern replacement for traditional BIOS.
- Provides:
  - Better compatibility with new hardware.
  - More advanced features (e.g., graphical interfaces, larger disk support).
- Most modern systems ship with UEFI, but it serves the same basic function as BIOS.

## 4. POST (Power-On Self-Test)
- Runs automatically when you power on a system.
- Checks hardware to ensure components are working.
- Occurs **before drivers are loaded**.
- Feedback mechanism:
  - If video is not yet initialized, errors are indicated with **beep codes**.
  - Beep codes vary by manufacturer → check motherboard manual.
  - Example: 
    - 1 beep = successful boot.
    - 2 beeps = POST error.
  - Not all systems have built-in speakers.

## 5. CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)
- Special chip that stores **basic BIOS configuration**:
  - System date & time.
  - Boot sequence (e.g., HDD → USB → Network).
- Settings can be changed by entering **BIOS/CMOS setup menu**:
  - Typically accessed by pressing a key during startup (e.g., F2, Del, Esc, F10).

---

## 6. BIOS Settings in IT Support
- IT professionals use BIOS frequently for tasks like:
  - **Changing boot order** (e.g., to boot from USB or CD).
  - **Reimaging computers**:
    - Reimaging = wiping and reinstalling the OS using a disk image.
    - Image source: USB drive, CD-ROM, or network server.
    - BIOS must be set to boot from the external device containing the image.

## 7. Key Takeaways for IT Specialists
- Know how to **access and configure BIOS/UEFI**.
- Understand **POST behavior and beep codes** for troubleshooting.
- Be able to adjust **boot sequence** for OS installation and recovery.
- Recognize that BIOS/UEFI is essential for the transition from hardware → OS.
