# Installing Graphics Card and Peripherals ‚Äì Study Guide

This section covers the **final steps of PC assembly**: powering the motherboard and CPU, connecting case cables, installing the graphics card, and adding peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse). Finally, we perform the **first boot test**.

## 1. Powering the Motherboard and CPU üîå
- **Main Motherboard Power Connector**:
  - A **large 20+4 pin connector** from the PSU.
  - Plug this into the corresponding slot on the motherboard.
  - Supplies power to the entire board and components.

- **CPU Power Connector**:
  - Usually a **4-pin or 8-pin connector** (EPS12V).
  - Connects near the CPU socket.
  - Provides dedicated power to the CPU.

‚úÖ Once both are connected, the **motherboard + CPU are powered**.

## 2. Connecting Case Cables üñ≤Ô∏è
- **Purpose**: Case cables control the **power button, reset button, power LED, HDD activity LED**, and sometimes front-panel USB/audio.
- **Steps**:
  1. Locate the **front panel header** on the motherboard (marked `F_PANEL` or similar).
  2. Connect each cable (usually labeled: `POWER SW`, `RESET SW`, `HDD LED`, etc.).
  3. Consult the **motherboard manual** for the exact pin layout.
  4. Use cable guides or ties to keep the inside neat.

üí° Tip: Proper cable management improves **airflow** and makes troubleshooting easier.

## 3. Installing the Graphics Card (GPU) üéÆ
- **Locate the PCIe Slot**:
  - Use the **top PCIe x16 slot** on the motherboard for the GPU.
- **Installation process**:
  1. Remove the case‚Äôs PCI slot cover (aligned with GPU output ports).
  2. Insert GPU into the PCIe slot with firm pressure until you hear a **‚Äúclick‚Äù**.
  3. Secure GPU to case with screws.
  4. Connect **PCIe power cables** (6-pin/8-pin) from PSU if required.
     - Modern GPUs require **additional power** beyond PCIe slot.

‚úÖ GPU is installed when seated properly, screwed in, and powered.

## 4. Connecting Peripherals üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è
- **Keyboard & Mouse**:
  - Typically USB connections ‚Üí plug into rear USB ports.
- **Monitor**:
  - Use appropriate video cable:
    - **DisplayPort** (modern, best for high refresh rate).
    - **HDMI** (common for most monitors/TVs).
    - **DV**
