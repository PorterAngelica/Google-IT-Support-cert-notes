# Motherboards – Study Guide

## 1. Overview
The **motherboard** is the **foundation of a computer**. It:

- Holds all components together.
- Allows components to communicate with each other.
- Routes power from the power supply.
- Supports expansion cards to extend functionality.

**Analogy:** Think of the motherboard as the **backbone and circulatory system** of the computer, connecting all organs (CPU, RAM, peripherals) and supplying power.

## 2. Key Characteristics of Motherboards

### 2.1 Chipset
The **chipset** determines how the CPU, RAM, and peripherals communicate.

- Comprised of **two main chips**:
  1. **Northbridge**
     - Interconnects **high-speed components** like RAM and video cards.
     - In modern CPUs, often **integrated into the CPU** itself.
  2. **Southbridge**
     - Manages **I/O controllers**, such as hard drives, USB devices, and other peripheral interfaces.

**Purpose:** Manages **data flow** between CPU, RAM, and connected devices.

---

### 2.2 Expansion Slots
- Enable adding **extra hardware functionality** (graphics cards, network cards, sound cards, etc.).
- Standard today: **PCI Express (PCIe)** – Peripheral Component Interconnect Express.
  - PCIe slot: Found on motherboard
  - PCIe expansion card: Small circuit board that plugs into the slot
- Allows for **upgrades without replacing the entire motherboard**.

**Example:** Installing a new graphics card via PCIe to improve gaming performance.

### 2.3 Form Factor
Motherboards come in different **sizes and layouts**, which affect:

- Number of expansion slots.
- Compatibility with RAM and CPU sockets.
- Overall system size and airflow.

**Common Form Factors:**

| Form Factor | Size | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| **ATX** | Full-size | Most common in desktops; supports maximum expansion |
| **Micro ATX (mATX)** | Smaller than ATX | Fewer slots, compact design |
| **Mini ITX** | Even smaller | Minimal expansion, small builds |
| **Nano ITX / Pico ITX** | Tiny boards | Ultra-compact systems like Intel NUC |

**Considerations When Choosing Form Factor:**

- Small builds → fewer slots, limited performance upgrades
- Workstation builds → larger boards, more slots, maximum functionality

---

### 2.4 Compatibility Considerations
- **RAM module type:** Must match motherboard slot type (DDR generation, pin count).
- **CPU socket:** Must match motherboard socket type (LGA or PGA).
- **Expansion card size:** Must physically fit within the motherboard layout.

**Scenario:** If a user has video issues, buying a replacement graphics card requires ensuring the card is compatible with the motherboard’s PCIe slot and space available in the case.

## 3. Summary Table

| Component | Purpose | Key Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Chipset | Data management between CPU, RAM, and peripherals | Northbridge (RAM, GPU), Southbridge (I/O devices) |
| Expansion Slots | Add extra hardware functionality | Standard: PCIe |
| Form Factor | Physical size and layout of motherboard | Determines expansion slots, compatible components |
| Compatibility | Ensures CPU, RAM, and expansion cards fit | Check CPU socket, RAM type, PCIe slot size |

## 4. Practical Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| Motherboard | Backbone and circulatory system of the computer |
| Northbridge | Highway for high-speed data (RAM, GPU) |
| Southbridge | Local roads for peripheral devices (USB, storage) |
| PCIe Slot | Parking spot for new hardware cards |
| Form Factor | Building size – determines how much can fit inside |
