# Introduction to Computer Hardware – Study Guide

## 1. Overview
Computers are **ubiquitous** — found in homes, workplaces, airports, stores, and even in our pockets.  
Regardless of size or form, **all computers** share the same core purpose:
- **Calculate** data
- **Process** data
- **Store** data

This guide explains the physical components inside a typical computer and their functions.

## 2. Types of Computer Setups

### 2.1 Desktop Computers 🖥️
- Fits on or under a desk.
- Typical external components:
  - **Monitor** (display output)
  - **Keyboard** (input device)
  - **Mouse** (input device)
  - **Desktop tower/case**
  - Optional peripherals: webcam, speakers, printer

### 2.2 Laptops 💻
- Portable computers with built-in:
  - Monitor
  - Keyboard
  - Trackpad/mouse
- Same basic components as desktops, but **miniaturized** and **hidden inside** for portability.

### 2.3 Mobile Phones 📱
- Highly compact computing devices.
- Contain **scaled-down versions** of the same hardware found in desktops/laptops.

## 3. Hardware Definition
- **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer you can touch.
- **Software**: Logical/program components you cannot physically touch (OS, apps, etc.).

## 4. Ports and Connectivity

### 4.1 Definition
- **Ports**: Connection points that extend a computer’s functionality by allowing external devices to interface.

### 4.2 Common Ports (examples from a desktop)
| Port Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Power Port** | Connects to electrical outlet. |
| **Display Port (e.g., HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA)** | Connects monitor to display visual output. |
| **USB Ports** | Connects keyboard, mouse, storage devices, and other peripherals. |
| **Ethernet Port** | Wired network connection for internet or LAN access. |

> **Note:** A minimal set of ports (display, keyboard/mouse, network) allows for basic web browsing and general computing.

## 5. Internal Components of a Desktop Computer

### 5.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU) 🧠
- **Role:** Brain of the computer.
- Performs calculations and processes data.
- Interacts heavily with RAM.
- Covered by a **heat sink** (and often a fan) to dissipate heat.
- Located on the **motherboard**.

### 5.2 Random Access Memory (RAM)
- **Role:** Short-term memory.
- Temporarily stores data while the computer is powered on.
- Volatile — contents are erased when power is off.
- Example usage: While typing in a word processor or chat, text is stored in RAM before being saved.

### 5.3 Hard Drive (HDD) / Solid State Drive (SSD)
- **Role:** Long-term storage.
- Stores data such as music, pictures, applications, and the operating system.
- Persistent — data remains even after power is off.

### 5.4 Motherboard
- **Role:** Main circuit board connecting all components.
- Provides communication pathways between CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.
- Considered the **foundation** or **circulatory system** of the computer.

### 5.5 Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- **Role:** Converts electricity from a wall outlet (AC) into a usable form (DC) for computer components.
- Supplies correct voltages to motherboard, storage, and peripherals.

## 6. Hardware Across Devices
- **Desktop, laptop, mobile phone** → all contain:
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Storage
  - Power supply (battery or PSU)
  - Mainboard/motherboard equivalent
- Differences:
  - Size
  - Power consumption
  - Integration level

---

## 7. Practical Applications in IT Support
- **Understanding hardware** is essential for:
  - Troubleshooting physical component issues.
  - Identifying faulty parts (RAM, PSU, etc.).
  - Performing upgrades or replacements.
- IT staff often **disassemble** and **inspect** components to diagnose problems.

## 9. Key Points to Remember ⚡
- **CPU** = Brain → calculations and processing.
- **RAM** = Short-term memory → volatile.
- **Storage (HDD/SSD)** = Long-term memory → persistent.
- **Motherboard** = Communication hub.
- **PSU** = Power conversion.
- **Ports** allow external connectivity and expansion.
- Same basic components exist across all modern computing devices.
