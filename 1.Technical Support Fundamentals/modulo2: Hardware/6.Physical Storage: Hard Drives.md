# Physical Storage: Hard Drives – Study Guide

## 1. Data Units Overview
Understanding storage starts with knowing **data units**:

| Unit | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Bit** | 1 binary digit | Stores a 0 or 1 |
| **Byte** | 8 bits | Can store 1 character (letter, number, symbol) |
| **Kilobyte (KB)** | 1,024 bytes | Approx. size of a small text file |
| **Megabyte (MB)** | 1,024 KB | Approx. size of a music file (~3 MB) |
| **Gigabyte (GB)** | 1,024 MB | Approx. 165,000 music files on a 500 GB drive |
| **Terabyte (TB)** | 1,024 GB | Large storage for backups, videos, or databases |

## 2. Types of Hard Drives

### 2.1 Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Uses **spinning platters** and a **mechanical arm** to read/write data.
- **Speed** measured in **RPM (revolutions per minute)**:
  - Higher RPM → faster read/write speeds.
  - Example: 500 GB, 5,400 RPM.
- **Pros:** Affordable, large storage capacity.
- **Cons:** Mechanical parts → prone to damage, slower than SSD.

### 2.2 Solid State Drives (SSD)
- No moving parts; stores data on **microchips**.
- Faster read/write than HDDs.
- Slimmer form factor → compact installation.
- **Pros:** Faster, less prone to mechanical failure.
- **Cons:** More expensive per GB, less total capacity compared to HDD.
- Example: SSDs in laptops, USB sticks, NVMe drives.

### 2.3 Hybrid Drives
- Combines **SSD performance** for system-critical data with **HDD capacity** for large files.
- Common in laptops where speed + storage is required.

## 3. Interfaces for Hard Drives

### 3.1 SATA (Serial ATA)
- Uses **cable for data transfer**.
- **Hot-swappable**: can plug in without powering down the machine.
- Standard interface for most HDDs.
- Example: SATA III drives.

### 3.2 NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)
- Connects via **expansion slot** directly to motherboard.
- Allows **higher throughput** and **faster speeds** than SATA.
- Designed for modern SSDs.

## 4. Key Considerations
- Always **backup important data** to prevent loss.
- HDD vs SSD choice depends on:
  - Budget
  - Required speed
  - Storage size
- For system performance: **SSD for OS and programs, HDD for bulk storage**.
- Hybrid drives can balance **speed and cost**.
