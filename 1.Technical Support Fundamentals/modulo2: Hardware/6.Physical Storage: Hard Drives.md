# Physical Storage: Hard Drives – Study Guide

## 1. Data Units Overview
Understanding storage starts with knowing **data units**:

| Unit | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Bit** | 1 binary digit | Stores a 0 or 1 |
| **Byte** | 8 bits | Can store 1 character (letter, number, symbol) |
| **Kilobyte (KB)** | 1,024 bytes | Approx. size of a small text file |
| **Megabyte (MB)** | 1,024 KB | Approx. size of a music file (~3 MB) |
| **Gigabyte (GB)** | 1,024 MB | Approx. 165,000 music files on a 500 GB drive |
| **Terabyte (TB)** | 1,024 GB | Large storage for backups, videos, or databases |

## 2. Types of Hard Drives

### 2.1 Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Uses **spinning platters** and a **mechanical arm** to read/write data.
- **Speed** measured in **RPM (revolutions per minute)**:
  - Higher RPM → faster read/write speeds.
  - Example: 500 GB, 5,400 RPM.
- **Pros:** Affordable, large storage capacity.
- **Cons:** Mechanical parts → prone to damage, slower than SSD.

### 2.2 Solid State Drives (SSD)
- No moving parts; stores data on **microchips**.
- Faster read/write than HDDs.
- Slimmer form factor → compact installation.
- **Pros:** Faster, less prone to mechanical failure.
- **Cons:** More expensive per GB, less total capacity compared to HDD.
- Example: SSDs in laptops, USB sticks, NVMe drives.

### 2.3 Hybrid Drives
- Combines **SSD performance** for system-critical data with **HDD capacity** for large files.
- Common in laptops where speed + storage is required.

## 3. Interfaces for Hard Drives

### 3.1 SATA (Serial ATA)
- Uses **cable for data transfer**.
- **Hot-swappable**: can plug in without powering down the machine.
- Standard interface for most HDDs.
- Example: SATA III drives.

### 3.2 NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)
- Connects via **expansion slot** directly to motherboard.
- Allows **higher throughput** and **faster speeds** than SATA.
- Designed for modern SSDs.

---

## 4. Key Considerations
- Always **backup important data** to prevent loss.
- HDD vs SSD choice depends on:
  - Budget
  - Required speed
  - Storage size
- For system performance: **SSD for OS and programs, HDD for bulk storage**.
- Hybrid drives can balance **speed and cost**.

# Supplemental Reading for Data Storage

## Data Storage Measurements
In this reading, you will learn about the different names for measurements of data storage capacities and file sizes. Data storage capacity increases with the evolution of computer hardware technology. Larger storage capacities allow for dynamic growth in file sizes. These advances make it possible for companies like Netflix and Hulu to store thousands of feature-length films in high-quality formats.  

There are standardized terms used to describe data storage and file sizes. Common terms include:

- **Bytes**  
- **Kilobytes (KB)**  
- **Megabytes (MB)**  
- **Gigabytes (GB)**  
- **Terabytes (TB)**  

Computer engineers might use a different set of terms for more precise measurements.

## Data Storage Measurement Nomenclature

### Decimal Values (Base 10)
**Decimal nomenclature:** kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, yottabyte  

- Uses metric system prefixes from the **International System of Units (SI)**: kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, zetta, yotta.  
- Represents a **base-10 approximation** of actual bytes.  
- Metric prefixes were selected to **simplify marketing** of computer products.  

---

### Binary Values (Base 2)
**Binary nomenclature:** kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte, tebibyte, pebibyte, exbibyte, zebibyte, yobibyte  

- Standardized by **ISO** and **IEC** (ISO 80000 & IEC 80000).  
- Prefixes like **kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, tebi-** combine the first two letters of the metric prefix with the first two letters of *binary*.  
  - Example: megabyte + binary + byte = **mebibyte**  
- **Binary measurements** are more accurate than decimal ones.  
- Decimal terms are common in marketing; binary terms are preferred in engineering for accuracy.

## Quantities of Storage Measurements

### One Bit
- Also called a **binary digit**.  
- Stores an electric signal as 1, absence as 0.  
- Basis of **binary number system (base-2)**.  

### One Byte
- Stores **8 bits** (ones and zeros) representing a symbol or instruction.  
- Example: `01101101` = "m", `01111111` = delete character to the right of cursor.
