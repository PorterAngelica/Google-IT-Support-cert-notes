# Mobile Device Repair – Study Guide

Repairing **mobile devices** (smartphones, tablets, etc.) is different from repairing desktop computers. This guide covers **organizational policies, warranties, tools, and best practices**.

---

## 1. Organizational Policies 📜
- **Check company policy** before attempting repairs.
- Some organizations allow in-house repairs, while others require sending devices to the manufacturer/vendor.
- Always confirm whether:
  - You are **permitted** to perform the repair.
  - The repair might **void the warranty**.
  - Devices must be handled via **RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization)**.

## 2. Warranties & Repair Permissions 🛠️
- **Warranties** often restrict what you can do:
  - Example: You may be allowed to **replace a cracked screen**.
  - But not allowed to **replace a damaged charging port**.
- If you repair something **not covered by your role**, you risk:
  - Voiding the warranty.
  - Making the organization liable for replacement costs.
- For unauthorized repairs → use **RMA process**:
  - Contact manufacturer/vendor.
  - Provide device details (serial number, issue, warranty status).
  - Ship the device for repair/replacement.

## 3. Handling Data Before Repairs 🔐
- Devices may contain **proprietary or personal data**.
- **Before sending for repair:**
  - Perform a **factory reset**:
    - Removes all data, apps, and customizations.
    - Restores the device to its default settings.
- Ensures **data security** and compliance with privacy regulations.

  - Power on the device.
  - Test **core functionality** (screen, buttons, charging port, speakers, mic, Wi-Fi, etc.).
  - Confirm the issue is resolved.

## 6. Step-by-Step Repair Workflow
1. **Check policy** – Are you allowed to repair this device?
