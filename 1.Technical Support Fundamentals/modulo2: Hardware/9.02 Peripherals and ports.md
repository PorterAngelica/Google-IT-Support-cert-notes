# Peripherals and Ports – Study Guide

## 1. Overview
- **Peripherals** are external devices connected to a computer to add functionality.
- Common peripherals: **mouse, keyboard, monitor, USB devices**.

---

## 2. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- Most popular type of peripheral connection.
- Versions commonly encountered:
  - **USB 2.0** – slower, typically black ports
  - **USB 3.0** – faster, typically blue ports
  - **USB 3.1** – faster still, often teal ports
- **Important distinction:**  
  - Mb/s = megabits per second (data transfer rate)  
  - MB = megabyte (data storage)  
  - 1 MB = 8 Mb

- **Backward compatibility:**  
  - A USB 2.0 device works in a USB 3.0 port, but at 2.0 speeds.

- **USB Type-C**:  
  - Emerging universal standard for display, data transfer, and power delivery.
  - Can replace multiple peripheral connections.

---

## 3. Display Peripherals
- Common display connections for monitors and projectors:
  - **DVI**: Video only, older standard.
  - **HDMI**: Video and audio, widely used in modern TVs and computers.
  - **DisplayPort**: Video and audio, increasingly common.
  - **USB Type-C**: Can handle video, audio, data transfer, and power.

---

## 4. IT Support Considerations
- Be able to **identify USB versions and port types**.
- Understand **which cables carry audio, video, and data**.
- Recognize **compatibility issues** (e.g., using older cables with newer devices).
- Assist end-users with connecting **peripherals** properly.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Label or color-code USB ports for easier identification.
- Use appropriate cables for intended functionality (audio/video/data).
- Keep a variety of adapters handy (USB-C to HDMI, USB-C to USB-A, etc.).

# Supplemental Reading: Connector Types

A computer has many **physical ports (connectors)** used to attach external devices called **peripherals** (e.g., keyboard, mouse, monitor). IT professionals often work with and troubleshoot these, so it’s important to understand the different types of connectors.

## USB Connectors

### USB 2.0, 3.0 & 3.1
USB connectors transfer **data and power**.  
Three main generations of USB Type-A ports are in use:

- **USB 2.0** → Black port, **480 Mbps** transfer speed  
- **USB 3.0** → Blue port, **5 Gbps** transfer speed  
- **USB 3.1** → Teal port, **10 Gbps** transfer speed  

⚡ **Backwards compatibility:** Any USB Type-A device can connect to any USB port, but the **cable and port combination determines the speed**.  
(e.g., USB 3.0 cable in a USB 2.0 port = 480 Mbps max)

### Micro USB, USB-C, USB4 & Lightning Port
These are **smaller, faster, and more powerful** than older USB connectors.

- **Micro USB** → Found on many non-Apple phones, tablets, and portable devices  
- **USB-C** → Reversible connector, **20 Gbps** speed, high power capacity  
- **USB4 (Thunderbolt 3)** → Uses USB-C, **40 Gbps** transfer + power delivery  
- **Lightning Port** (Apple) → Exclusive to iPhones/iPads, similar to USB-C, used for charging, monitors, cameras, etc.

## Communication Connectors
Used to share information between devices and connect to the internet.

- **POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service):** Uses twisted copper pair wires.  
  - Connector: **RJ-11** (landline phones, dial-up, alarms)  

- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):** Internet access via telephone lines + modem.  
  - Connector: **RJ-45** (Ethernet cables)  

- **Cable Internet:** Uses TV cable infrastructure + modem.  
  - Connector: **F-type**  

- **Fiber Optic:** Glass fiber cables for **long-distance, high-speed internet**.  
  - Used by major internet providers

## Device Connectors

- **DB89** → Legacy connector for older peripherals (keyboards, mice, joysticks)  
- **Molex** → Provides power to drives/devices inside the computer  
  - Examples: hard drives, CD/DVD/Blu-ray drives, video cards

---

## Punch Down Blocks
A **terminal strip** used to connect **telephone or data lines**.  
- Quick/easy way to connect or re-route wiring  
- Used in **LANs** and **telephone systems**

## Key Takeaways
- IT professionals need to recognize **connector types** for peripherals.  
- **USB connectors** are the most common, transferring both data and power.  
- **Communication connectors** (RJ-45, fiber optics) link devices to the internet.  
- **Legacy connectors** (DB89, Molex) may still be found in older devices.  
- **Punch down blocks** are essential for managing telephone/data wiring in networks.
