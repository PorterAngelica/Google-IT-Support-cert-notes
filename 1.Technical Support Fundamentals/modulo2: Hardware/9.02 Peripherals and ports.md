# Peripherals and Ports – Study Guide

## 1. Overview
- **Peripherals** are external devices connected to a computer to add functionality.
- Common peripherals: **mouse, keyboard, monitor, USB devices**.

---

## 2. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- Most popular type of peripheral connection.
- Versions commonly encountered:
  - **USB 2.0** – slower, typically black ports
  - **USB 3.0** – faster, typically blue ports
  - **USB 3.1** – faster still, often teal ports
- **Important distinction:**  
  - Mb/s = megabits per second (data transfer rate)  
  - MB = megabyte (data storage)  
  - 1 MB = 8 Mb

- **Backward compatibility:**  
  - A USB 2.0 device works in a USB 3.0 port, but at 2.0 speeds.

- **USB Type-C**:  
  - Emerging universal standard for display, data transfer, and power delivery.
  - Can replace multiple peripheral connections.

## 3. Display Peripherals
- Common display connections for monitors and projectors:
  - **DVI**: Video only, older standard.
  - **HDMI**: Video and audio, widely used in modern TVs and computers.
  - **DisplayPort**: Video and audio, increasingly common.
  - **USB Type-C**: Can handle video, audio, data transfer, and power.

---

## 4. IT Support Considerations
- Be able to **identify USB versions and port types**.
- Understand **which cables carry audio, video, and data**.
- Recognize **compatibility issues** (e.g., using older cables with newer devices).
- Assist end-users with connecting **peripherals** properly.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Label or color-code USB ports for easier identification.
- Use appropriate cables for intended functionality (audio/video/data).
- Keep a variety of adapters handy (USB-C to HDMI, USB-C to USB-A, etc.).
