# Power Supplies – Study Guide

## 1. Purpose of a Power Supply
- Converts electricity from the **wall outlet (AC)** into **DC voltage** usable by the computer.
- Provides stable power to all internal components like **CPU, RAM, motherboard, and drives**.

---

## 2. Types of Electricity
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AC (Alternating Current)** | Changes direction constantly; comes from the wall outlet. |
| **DC (Direct Current)** | Flows in one direction; used by computer components. |

---

## 3. Analogy: Water Pressure
- **Voltage (V)** → Pressure pushing electricity through circuits.
  - Higher voltage = more “pressure”.
- **Current / Amperage (A)** → Amount of electricity flowing; like water being pulled through pipes.
  - Higher amperage = more electricity pulled, can charge devices faster.
- **Wattage (W)** → Total electrical power; combination of volts × amps.
  - Determines if a power supply can handle the computer's load.

---

## 4. Power Supply Components
- **Fan** → Cools the PSU.
- **Cables** → Connect PSU to motherboard, drives, and peripherals.
- **Voltage Information** → Usually listed on the PSU label (e.g., 12V, 5V, etc.).
- **Power Cable** → Connects PSU to wall outlet.

---

## 5. Choosing the Right Power Supply
- **Minimum Wattage**: A basic desktop → ~500 W.
- **High-Demand Systems**:
  - Gaming PCs, video production → may require 650 W–1000 W or more.
- **Excess Wattage**: Safe; PSU only provides what the system uses.
- **Voltage & Amperage**: Match the requirements of components to avoid damage.

---

## 6. Common Issues
- Computer won’t turn on → PSU failure.
- **Causes of PSU failure**:
  - Burnouts
  - Power surges
  - Lightning strikes
- Diagnosing & replacing a PSU is a critical IT support skill.

---

## 7. Safety Tips
- Always check **voltage compatibility** for your devices.
- Avoid plugging high-voltage appliances into lower-voltage outlets (can damage devices).
- Ensure PSU wattage is sufficient for your system’s total power needs.

# Power Supplies Reading

## Overview
In this reading, you will learn how to select the correct **power supply** for a personal computer (PC) to support its main components.  

Computer systems require **direct current (DC)** to operate, but power companies deliver **alternating current (AC)**. AC power can damage computer components. **Power supplies** convert AC from the wall into DC and reduce the voltage to safe levels for internal components.  

---

## Computer Architecture
**Computer architecture** refers to the engineering design of computers and the interconnecting hardware components that together meet functional, performance, and cost goals.  

Power supplies are part of the **hardware layer**. Other major components include:

- Motherboard  
- Chipsets  
- CPU(s)  
- RAM  
- Storage  
- Peripherals  
- Expansion slots and cards  

These components influence the **size and type of power supply** required.

## Selecting a Power Supply

### Local Input Voltage
A key factor is the **voltage delivered to wall sockets** in your country.  

- **VAC** = volts alternating current  
- Common voltage inputs: **110-120 VAC** or **220-240 VAC**  

#### Voltages in the Americas
- North, Central, and parts of South America: **110-127 VAC**  
- Computers and power supplies in these regions are designed for this standard.  

#### Voltages for Most of the World
- Most other countries: **220-240 VAC**  
- Computers and power supplies in these regions are designed for this higher voltage.  

For country-specific standards, visit: [WorldStandards “Plug, socket & voltage by country”](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/)  

#### Adapting Voltage
If a computer is imported from a country with a different voltage standard:

1. **Replace the power supply** with one appropriate for the target country.  
2. **Use a dual-voltage power supply** (switchable between 110-120VAC and 220-240VAC).  
3. **Plug the computer into an external power converter** for the correct voltage.  

**Problems without proper conversion:**

| Computer Needs | Wall Delivers | Result |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| 220-240 VAC    | 110-120 VAC   | Not enough power to run properly |
| 110-120 VAC    | 220-240 VAC   | Too much power; damages internal parts |

---

### Motherboard Engineering Specifications
- Motherboard **form factor** and specifications list compatible power supply types.  
- **ATX** is the most common motherboard design; **ITX** is used in smaller computers.  
- Form factor and embedded components influence the **minimum required power supply wattage**.  

---

### Power Consumption of Components
- The **number of internal components and peripherals** determines the minimum wattage required.  
- Examples:  
  - Basic word processing and internet usage → standard power supply  
  - High-performance CPU, multiple drives, high-end GPU, video rendering → higher wattage required  

---

### Voltages and Pin Connectors
Internal components require different input voltages. **Motherboard voltage regulators** control the power delivered to each component.  

| Voltage | Components Example |
|---------|------------------|
| 3.3V    | DIMMs, chipsets, some PCI/AGP cards |
| 5V      | SIMMs, disk drive logic, ISA, some voltage regulators |
| 12V     | Motors, high-output voltage regulators |

**Motherboard Power Connectors:**

- Standard ATX power adapters: **20-pin or 24-pin**  
- 20-pin = older technology  
- 24-pin = supports additional expansion cards, powerful CPUs, modern standard  

**Other connectors for components:**

- Floppy disk drive (obsolete)  
- Molex (IDE hard drives, optical drives)  
- SATA drives  
- Graphics cards: 6-pin, 8-pin (separable for 6-pin)  
- Motherboard 8-pin and P4 connector (can combine to 8-pin 12V)  
- ATX 24-pin (divisible 20+4; backward compatible with 20-pin)  

> Installation of power supplies and connection of these cables is covered later in the module.

## Key Takeaways
When selecting a power supply, consider:

1. **Wall socket input voltage** for the country of use  
2. **Number and power needs** of internal components  
3. **Motherboard model and form factor** specifications
