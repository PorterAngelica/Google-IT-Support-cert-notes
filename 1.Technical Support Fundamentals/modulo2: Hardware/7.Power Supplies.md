# Power Supplies – Study Guide

## 1. Purpose of a Power Supply
- Converts electricity from the **wall outlet (AC)** into **DC voltage** usable by the computer.
- Provides stable power to all internal components like **CPU, RAM, motherboard, and drives**.

## 2. Types of Electricity
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AC (Alternating Current)** | Changes direction constantly; comes from the wall outlet. |
| **DC (Direct Current)** | Flows in one direction; used by computer components. |

## 3. Analogy: Water Pressure
- **Voltage (V)** → Pressure pushing electricity through circuits.
  - Higher voltage = more “pressure”.
- **Current / Amperage (A)** → Amount of electricity flowing; like water being pulled through pipes.
  - Higher amperage = more electricity pulled, can charge devices faster.
- **Wattage (W)** → Total electrical power; combination of volts × amps.
  - Determines if a power supply can handle the computer's load.

## 4. Power Supply Components
- **Fan** → Cools the PSU.
- **Cables** → Connect PSU to motherboard, drives, and peripherals.
- **Voltage Information** → Usually listed on the PSU label (e.g., 12V, 5V, etc.).
- **Power Cable** → Connects PSU to wall outlet.

## 5. Choosing the Right Power Supply
- **Minimum Wattage**: A basic desktop → ~500 W.
- **High-Demand Systems**:
  - Gaming PCs, video production → may require 650 W–1000 W or more.
- **Excess Wattage**: Safe; PSU only provides what the system uses.
- **Voltage & Amperage**: Match the requirements of components to avoid damage.

---

## 6. Common Issues
- Computer won’t turn on → PSU failure.
- **Causes of PSU failure**:
  - Burnouts
  - Power surges
  - Lightning strikes
- Diagnosing & replacing a PSU is a critical IT support skill.

---

## 7. Safety Tips
- Always check **voltage compatibility** for your devices.
- Avoid plugging high-voltage appliances into lower-voltage outlets (can damage devices).
- Ensure PSU wattage is sufficient for your system’s total power needs.
