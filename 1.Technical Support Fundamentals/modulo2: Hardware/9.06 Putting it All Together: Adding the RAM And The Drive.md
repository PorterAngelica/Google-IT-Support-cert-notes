# Installing RAM, Storage Drive, Cooling Fan, and Power Supply ‚Äì Study Guide

This guide covers the next major steps in building a desktop PC: **adding RAM modules, installing storage drives (SSD/HDD), setting up case fans, and mounting the power supply unit (PSU).**

## 1. Installing the RAM (Memory Modules) üß†
- **Locate the DIMM slots** on your motherboard:
  - Usually 2‚Äì4 slots, sometimes color-coded (e.g., black & white).
- **Check compatibility**:
  - This build uses **DDR3 RAM** (yours may be DDR4 or DDR5).
- **Visual alignment**:
  - Match the **notch on the RAM stick** with the **divider in the slot** before inserting.
- **Insertion process**:
  1. Hold RAM module by the edges (avoid touching gold pins).
  2. Line up module with slot.
  3. Firmly press down until you hear a **‚Äúclick‚Äù**.
  4. **Both locking clips** on the sides should snap into place.
- **Dual-channel setup**:
  - If using 2 sticks on a 4-slot motherboard, install in matching colors (e.g., both white) for best performance.

‚úÖ RAM is installed when all sticks are secure and clips are locked.

## 2. Installing the Storage Drive (SSD/HDD) üíæ
- **Types**:
  - **HDD**: mechanical hard drive (slower).
  - **SSD**: solid-state drive (faster, no moving parts).
- **Mounting the drive**:
  - Place the SSD into the **drive cage** inside the case.
  - Some cases use screws, others allow tool-less slide-in with a ‚Äúclick.‚Äù
- **Connecting cables**:
  - Use a **SATA data cable**:
    - One end ‚Üí SSD.
    - Other end ‚Üí motherboard SATA port.
  - Remember: **SATA connectors are keyed** (fit only one way).

‚úÖ The SSD is installed once it is secured in the cage and connected to the motherboard.

## 3. Installing Case Fan(s) üå¨Ô∏è
- **Purpose**: Maintain airflow ‚Üí prevents overheating.
- **Placement**:
  - Rear/top fans = **exhaust** (push hot air out).
  - Front/bottom fans = **intake** (pull cool air in).
- **Steps**:
  1. Insert fan into case mounting grooves.
  2. Secure with screws.
  3. Connect fan cable:
     - Some fans use **3/4-pin connectors** (connect to ‚ÄúSYS_FAN‚Äù on motherboard).
     - Older fans may use **Molex connector** (directly to PSU).
- **Airflow best practice**:
  - Create a **wind tunnel effect**: Cool air in ‚Üí over components ‚Üí hot air out.

## 4. Installing the Power Supply Unit (PSU) üîå
- **Placement**:
  - Usually mounted at bottom or top of case.
  - Slide PSU into the case carefully (avoid hitting motherboard).
- **Securing**:
  1. Align screw holes of PSU with case.
  2. Use screws to secure (start with fingers, then tighten with screwdriver).
- **Cable management**:
  - Route cables to the side to prevent blocking airflow.
  - Modular PSUs let you connect only the cables you need.

‚úÖ PSU is installed once secured with screws and positioned neatly for airflow and cable access.

## 5. Step-by-Step Summary
1. **Install RAM**:
   - Align ‚Üí press down firmly ‚Üí locking clips snap.
2. **Install SSD**:
   - Slide into drive cage ‚Üí connect SATA data cable to motherboard.
3. **Install case fan**:
   - Screw into place ‚Üí connect to motherboard (SYS_FAN) or PSU (Molex).
4. **Install power supply**:
   - Slide into case ‚Üí secure with screws ‚Üí route cables neatly.

## 6. Glossary
- **DIMM Slot**: Memory slot for RAM modules on motherboard.
- **DDR3/DDR4/DDR5**: Different generations of RAM (not cross-compatible).
- **SATA Cable**: Thin data cable connecting storage drives to motherboard.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Faster storage device, no moving parts.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Mechanical storage device, slower but larger capacity.
- **Case Fan**: Fan installed in the case to improve airflow and cooling.
- **Molex Connector**: Older 4-pin power connector (used by some fans/older devices).
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)**: Provides electrical power to all components.
- **Modular PSU**: Allows detachable cables for better cable management.

üí° **Pro Tip:** Some builders prefer installing the **PSU before the motherboard** (depending on case design) to make space management easier.
