# CPU – Study Guide

## 1. Overview
The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of the computer.  
It processes binary data, performs calculations, and executes instructions.  

- Computers communicate in **binary (1s and 0s)**.
- Humans communicate in **human languages** (English, Spanish, etc.).
- CPUs translate human-readable instructions into **machine-readable binary instructions**.

---

## 2. Instruction Set
- **Definition:** A CPU’s built-in translation book of instructions it can execute.
- **Functions include:** Add, subtract, copy data, logical operations, jump, compare.
- **Program execution:** All programs are broken down into small instructions in the CPU's instruction set.
- **Hard-coded:** Different CPU manufacturers may use different instruction sets (Intel vs AMD vs Qualcomm), but the functionality is generally similar.
  
**Analogy:** Different car engines may be designed differently but perform the same function.

---

## 3. CPU Manufacturers and Examples
- Popular CPU manufacturers: **Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple**
- Common products:
  - Intel Core i7
  - AMD Athlon
  - Snapdragon 810
  - Apple A8
- Each has strengths and weaknesses depending on performance, power efficiency, and use case.

---

## 4. CPU Compatibility
- CPUs must be **compatible with the motherboard**.
- Motherboard is the **circuit board** connecting all components.
- CPU installation requires matching **CPU socket type**:
  - **Land Grid Array (LGA):** Pins protrude from the motherboard; CPU has flat contact points.
  - **Pin Grid Array (PGA):** Pins protrude from the CPU itself; motherboard has flat socket.
- **Tip:** Always check the CPU and motherboard specifications for compatibility.
  - Check box labeling or manufacturer’s website.

## 5. Cooling the CPU
- CPUs generate heat during operation → prone to overheating.
- **Heat sink:** Conducts heat away from the CPU.
- **Fan or liquid cooling:** Dissipates heat from the heat sink into the air or liquid.
- Proper cooling ensures **CPU longevity and stable performance**.

---

## 6. CPU Architecture – 32-bit vs 64-bit
- **Definition:** Architecture specifies how much data a CPU can efficiently process at once.
- **32-bit CPU:** Can handle 32 bits of data per operation.
- **64-bit CPU:** Can handle 64 bits of data per operation → can process larger numbers and access more memory.
- **Practical effect:** Determines maximum memory addressable and the size of registers.

## 7. CPU Components Recap
| Component | Function | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Instruction Set** | Built-in list of CPU operations | Add, subtract, compare, etc. |
| **Registers** | Small, fast storage inside CPU | Holds operands and results |
| **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** | Performs calculations and logic | Part of CPU |
| **Control Unit** | Directs instruction execution | Coordinates CPU components |
| **Clock** | Synchronizes CPU operations | Measured in GHz |
| **Cache** | High-speed memory for frequent data | L1, L2, L3 levels |

---

## 8. Practical Considerations in IT Support
- **Hardware replacements/upgrades:** CPU replacement must consider socket type, cooling requirements, and motherboard compatibility.
- **Performance evaluation:** Match CPU capabilities with computing needs (office tasks, gaming, video editing).
- **Troubleshooting:** Overheating can cause crashes → check heat sink and fan functionality.

---

## 9. Additional Notes
- CPU speed, cores, threads, and architecture are key for **overall system performance**.
- CPUs with multiple cores can execute instructions in **parallel**, improving multitasking.
- Always use **compatible thermal paste** when installing heat sinks.
- When upgrading, ensure the motherboard supports **CPU generation and chipset**.

## 10. CPU Flow Summary

```
[Program stored in storage] --> [RAM] --> [CPU instruction fetch]
--> [Registers & ALU execute operations] --> [Cache for frequently used data] --> [Result returned to RAM or storage]
```
